This was a map created for GIS course during my master's degree, in which I used the Graphical Modeler tool to identify raster cells that meet all site requirements. Site specifications include:

- Wind power: average annual wind speeds of greater than 6 m/s
- Land area: at least 6.25 contiguous hectares
- Sites must be within 7.5 km of a major road
- Sites cannot be within 7.5 km of an airport
- Sites cannot be within 1 mile of an existing urban area
- Sites cannot be within fire hazard zones
- Sites cannot be on public land


```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', out.height='200%', fig.pos='V', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/wind_sites.jpg"))
```
