Hi, welcome to my personal website and porfolio!

I am a master's student at UC Santa Barbara specializing in Energy & Climate and Pollution Prevention & Remediation, expected to graduate in June 2023. My interests include renewable energy development, land-use impacts, corporate sustainability, and regenerative agriculture. 

When I am not at school, I enjoy cooking, yoga, hiking, skiing, and spending time with friends. My hobbies include reading, crocheting, and newly, stained-glass projects.
