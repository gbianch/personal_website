Hi! Welcome to my site.

I am a master's student at UC Santa Barbara specializing in Energy &
Climate and Pollution Prevention & Remediation. My interests include
land-use impacts, renewable energy development, corporate
sustainability, and regenerative agriculture. When I am not at school, I
enjoy cooking, yoga, hiking, skiing, and spending time with friends.
