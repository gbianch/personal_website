This map was created in QGIS for GIS course at UCSB. I analyzed the cumulative impact of nine scenarios of sea level rise from 0 meters to 4 meters in mean seal level rise. The analysis focused on the potential impacts of sea-level rise in the downtown area of Santa Barbara, in which I calculated the areas flooded (in ha), parcels count, and the flooded property losses (in millions USD).
